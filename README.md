#### Description:

MindLog is a web application which allows you to simply and efficiently manage your workflow in a day-to-day basis.

### Why the MindLog is so unique

This application is based on three main productivity laws:

1. Work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion.

1. Your brain is not the best place to store your thoughts, ideas and tasks.

1. Every big task should be splitted into many small subtasks.

## Interface

Your page is divided into two parts. On the left side you can create tasks, subtasks and allocate fixed amount of time to some particular task which will start a timer. On the other you can write your thoughts, ideas and brand-new potential tasks which can come up to you while working.

## Main Functionality

1. add task/subtask
1. rename task/subtask
1. remove task/subtask
1. add timer
1. start timer
1. pause timer
1. finish timer
1. delete timer

Mind-thread

1. add text
1. edit text
1. delete text
1. add painter
1. erase painter
1. delete painter
1. add to-do
1. edit to-do
1. delete to-do

## What you can actually do with the MindLog

Let's assume I'm working on the p-set 3 and I want to complete Runoff problem.

So I click on "add a task button", type into "Runoff", press Enter. But you know what.. I've just changed my mind - I opt for something more difficult, so I'll go for Tideman. So I click on "edit btn" erase "Runoff" and type into "Tideman" instead.

But Tideman is really complicated and volume, so I'm going to create a subtask, which will be a vote() function: I click on "add subtask button", I type into "vote()" and now I think we already can allocate some time to it.

I click on "timer button" and set a timer just for five minutes (I think it will be enough).
When timer is finished I can either create a new subtask, which is a "record_preferences()" function if I have already completed this one or if I have not I can allocate more time to it. And by the way, when timer finishes, you will hear an alarm sound, which won't let you to skip your break.

While working on implementation of this function I can definitely have some useful thoughts in my mind (that's why mind-thread was created). So I click on "add a thought button" and here I should select a type. There are three types of a thought: text, to-do and painter.

For instance, I want to keep in mind the schema of every function, so I choose "text", I type into "input --> algorithm --> output" and later I can, of course, edit it or even delete.

Also I recall that I should call Mike. So I click on "add a thought" button, select "to-do" and type into "call Mike", which will create a task. And I can stop a timer and call Mike.

And my favourite type is one hundred percent "painter", which can come in handy when you want to visualize something. And here let's assume I want to visualize nodes which are our candidates. So I paint three nodes and two edges (just for simplicity sake) and now I can speak out my code, watch how my algorithm define, whether It should create an edge or It will create a cycle. And of course I can erase it or even delete if it's not usefu anymore.
