#### Description:

MindLog is a web application which allows you to simply and efficiently manage your workflow in a day-to-day basis.

### Why the MindLog is so unique

This application is based on three main productivity laws:

1. Work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion.

1. Your brain is not the best place to store your thoughts, ideas and tasks.

1. Every big task should be splitted into many small subtasks.

## Interface

Your page is divided into two parts. On the left side you can create tasks, subtasks and allocate fixed amount of time to some particular task which will start a timer. On the other you can write your thoughts, ideas and brand-new potential tasks which can come up to you while working.
